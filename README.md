This repository was created to revive "The Graveyard Project" and its website made in the Fall 2016 semester of
HUMAN-1050, taught at PITT Greensburg.

The original repo was hosted on the personal site of a
previous professor teaching HUMAN-1050; however, the website's owner removed the project's code,
taking down the project's website in the process. Thus, the primary goal for this revival project is to change any files and code
that were reliant on the old infrastructure so that the website lives again using Github Pages.

This project keeps changes to the original repo to the minimum, just enough to make the website
visible on the web again and functioning.

Other than filling this README with, well, text, the most significant change done to the original project
was
inserting the navigation and menu bars in all files. Originally, the project relied on server-side
includes (HTML comments of a particular syntax that tell the hosting
server to insert HTML code from other files) to break up pieces of web pages, such as the navigation
bar, across files and include them into other files as needed. Since we can't do that with Github
Pages, the full HTML is included in the HTML instead.

While this project wasn't created nor meant to fix the project's code or any layout issues, there were some other minor (commented) changes done to the website files that don't add or take away any of the project's original material:

* Submenus in the navigation bars would disappear as soon as the mouse cursor moved away from the menu item revealing them. This was fixed so that submenus are now hoverable. This was fixed in the "style.css" file.
* The default text color on member bios on one of the archiver's system and browser were unreadable, so the text color on only the member bios page was set to black in the "style.css" file.

The original project repo, if you're interested, is hosted also on Github, but it does not use Github Pages:
